**Pilot for Asteroid Navigation**
This repository features the implementation of a Pilot class designed for a simulation involving asteroid tracking and spacecraft navigation. The Pilot class employs a Kalman filter to estimate and predict the positions of asteroids, accounting for noisy measurements and
dynamically adjusting estimates over time. Additionally, it navigates a spacecraft through an asteroid field, optimizing for collision avoidance and efficient pathfinding towards a goal.

**Key Features:**
**Asteroid Tracking:** Utilizes Kalman filtering to manage and predict the trajectory of multiple asteroids.
**Navigation:** Implements a decision-making algorithm to guide a spacecraft safely through an asteroid field based on real-time data.
**Dynamic Estimation: **Adapts estimates and navigation strategies as asteroids move and new observations are received.
**Usage**
To use this implementation, you need to integrate it with the provided simulation environment and customize it based on specific requirements of the navigation and estimation tasks.
